         <p>Responsible party pursuant to data protection laws, in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is</p>
<br>
<p>Sebastian Netzker</p>
<p></p><h2>Your rights as the data subject</h2>
<p>You can exercise the following rights at any time using the contact details of our data protection officer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information on your data stored by us and the processing thereof (Art. 15 GDPR), </li>
<li>Rectification of inaccurate personal data (Art. 16 GDPR), </li>
<li>Deletion of your data stored by us (Art. 17 GDPR), </li>
<li>Restriction of the data processing, provided that we may not delete your data due to legal obligations (Art. 18 GDPR), </li>
<li>Objection to the processing of your data with us (Art. 21 GDPR) and </li>
<li>Data portability, provide that you have consented to the data processing or have entered into a contract with us (Art. 20 GDPR). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have given us consent, you may withdraw it at any time, which will remain in effect in the future.</p>
<p>You can contact a supervisory authority with a complaint at any time, e.g. the supervisory authority of the state of your residence or the authority that oversees us as the responsible party.</p>
<p>You’ll find a list of supervisory authorities (for the non-public area) with their respective addresses at:</p> 
<p>https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</p>
<p></p><h2>Contact form</h2>
<h3>Type and purpose of the processing</h3>
<p>The data you enter are used for individual communication with you. A valid e-mail address and your name are required for this communication, which serves to organize your inquiry and the respective subsequent reply. Providing additional information is optional.</p>
<h3>Legal basis</h3>
<p>The processing of the data entered in the contact form occurs on the basis of a legitimate interest (Art. 6 Para. 1 (f) GDPR).</p>
<p>By providing the contact form, our aim is to facilitate an uncomplicated means for you to contact us. The information you enter will be used to process the inquiry and saved for possible follow-up questions.</p>
<p>If you contact us to request an offer, the processing of the information provided in the contact form will occur in order to implement pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 Para. 1 (b) GDPR).</p>
<h3>Recipients</h3>
<p>Recipients of the data may be processors.</p>
<h3>Retention period</h3>
<p>The data will be deleted no later than 6 months after processing the inquiry.</p>
<p>Provided that we enter into a contract together, we will use the statutory retention periods in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) and delete your data according to the respective stipulated deadlines.</p>
<h3>Mandatory or required provision</h3>
<p>The provision of your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only process your inquiry if you provide us with your name, e-mail address and the reason for your inquiry.</p>
<p></p><h2>Using script libraries (Google Webfonts)</h2>
<h3>Type and purpose of the processing</h3>
<p>In order to present our content correctly and graphically appealing across all browsers, we use ‘Google Webfonts’ from Google LLC (1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, hereinafter ‘Google’) to display fonts on this website.</p>
<p>You’ll find the data protection guidelines of the library operator Google here: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a></p>
<h3>Legal basis</h3>
<p>Your consent is the legal basis for the integration of Google Webfonts and the associated data transfer to Google (Art. 6 Para. 1 (a) GDPR).</p>
<h3>Recipients</h3>
<p>The use of script libraries or font libraries automatically triggers a connection to the operator of the library. It is theoretically possible – but currently also unclear whether and to what end – that the operator, in this case Google, will collect data.</p>
<h3>Retention period</h3>
<p>We do not collect any personal data via the integration of Google Webfonts.</p>
<p>You’ll find additional information on Google Webfonts at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google’s privacy policy: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
<h3>Third country transfers</h3>
<p>Google processes your data in the United States of America and is subject to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework</a>.</p>
<h3>Mandatory or required provision</h3>
<p>The provision of your personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. However, the correct presentation of standard-fonts content is not possible without this provision.</p>
<h3>Revocation of consent</h3>
<p>The programming language JavaScript is regularly used to display content. Thus, you can opt out of the data processing by disabling JavaScript execution in your browser or by installing a JavaScript blocker. Please note that this may result in functional limitations on the website.</p>
<p></p><h2>SSL encryption</h2>
<p>To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state-of-the-art encryption methods (such as SSL) via HTTPS.</p>
<p></p><h2>Revision of our privacy policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy so that it always complies with current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services in the privacy policy, e.g. when introducing new services. Your next visit will be subject to the new privacy policy.</p>
<h2>Questions for the data protection officer</h2>
<p>If you have any questions pertaining to data protection, please send us an e-mail or contact the person responsible for data protection in our organization: </p>
